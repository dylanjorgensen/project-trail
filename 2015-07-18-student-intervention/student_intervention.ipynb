In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "* It works by combining the best parts of several weak learners. I think of it similar to a basketball coach assembling a team of mediocre players. Certain players will be better at certain positions. So he mixes around the height, weight and position of all the players to see which combination gets the most point. \n",
    "* Then once he has the right team positions he can start to “weight” the ball, towards the best player and away from the worst. For example imagine the team's center is really tall and playing against a short defender, the coach might tell the team to feed the ball to the center 60% of the time. "
